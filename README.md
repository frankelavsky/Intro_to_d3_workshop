# Intro_to_d3_workshop
This is an advanced-level, 3-part workshop series totalling ~9 hours of workshop time (depending on exercises). This workshop is geared towards an audience that has some familiarity with data analysis, data visualization, or web development already.  
  
Part one covers the basics of D3.js and building visualizations in the web.  
Part two covers animations and transitions and a few more advanced D3 concepts and techniques.  
Part three primarily focuses on practice: applying what the attendees learned in part one and two and building visualizations from scratch.
